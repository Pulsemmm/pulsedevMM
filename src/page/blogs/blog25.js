      head: "",
      discription:
        "In digital marketing when you do Advertisement, SEO, Email marketing or have chosen a digital platform where you target an audience, it will lead them to come to your landing page. And if your landing page is not good enough then what will happen? What if your reviews are bad? And your branding is below average. In all these cases digital marketing will not be able to do anything.",

      discription:
        "You cannot get good loyal customers for the long term this way. If you want to make a brand which will earn recurring income then no matter how good your digital marketing is and your product is not, you will not get the boost you are looking for.",

      discription:
        "This is a big opportunity for you. People assume that the market does not have scope for this because my competitor is not using digital marketing either. So why should I? This is the commonest digital marketing myth you hear from people.",

      head: "3. Digital Marketing is Only for Big Companies or Small Companies",
      discription:
        "People say two types of things, one group says “digital marketing is for small businesses” while the other says “digital marketing is for big businesses” let me burst your bubble and tell you that, “digital marketing is for every business no matter how big or small”. It does not matter if your budget started from only 1 Hundred per day or to 1 million per day. Both of these businesses can handle business marketing. So, it is a major digital marketing myth of 2021.",

      head: "4. Creating a Website is All You Need",
      discription:
        "People often say that “I have made my website; my digital marketing is done”. Making a website does not mean digital marketing. It only means that you have created your “Digital Identity”. And to attract your consumer to that digital identity you must-do digital marketing. If you have a physical shop and you made a website, it becomes your digital shop.",

      discription:
        "SEO cannot be killed. It is an evergreen topic. People will keep searching queries on Google and websites and their results will only come on behalf of SEO. Whether it is a blog or video SEO works for every search. Traffic coming from SEO is of quality. One good thing about SEO is that it only depends on your skills, and no money is involved in it.",

      discription:
        "People say that “Coded websites are better than WordPress websites”. These two things do not have much difference between them. In 2021 you can achieve the same result in either of these. And in WordPress, you get the advantage that you can start your work with a smaller budget. While using coding, you require a bigger budget from the start. The interface of WordPress is smart enough that you can easily upload products by yourself when using an e-commerce website. The issue only arises when your website gets heavy traffic like 100,000 people per day.",

By showing our ads on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. So, in order to do remarketing, you have to follow a multi-channel approach through different platforms which will make your conversion rate 10-fold.",

      discription:
        "An Instagram influencer could not even sell 36 t-shirts to her following of a worthy 2 million. So, your followers, subscribers, and likes are not all you need to market your business. If you are thinking, “I have a lot of followers and subscribers, they will buy everything from me”. so that is not the case.",
